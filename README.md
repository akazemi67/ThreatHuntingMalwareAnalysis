# ThreatHuntingMalwareAnalysis

Here I store sample codes and reports I created for threat hunting and malware analysis. 

The purpose of this repository is purely educational, and this is a place where I capture my thoughts and things I have learned while struggling with malware, running them in my laboratory, and capturing their behavior.
